# Translink API explorer

Very early days, this one, but it will hopefully become a website for visualising
NI Railways services using the Translink API.

_This is very experimental and not ready for production yet!_

My API key is limited to 3000 requests per day so get your own key! Follow the
instructions at https://www.translink.co.uk/api to get your key.

The site was built using Astro and Svelte, just because I like both.

## Installing

Prerequisites: Node.js v18 is installed (either on its own or using nvm)

Rename `.sample.env` to `.env`. In that file, add the API key you obtained
from Translink.

```
npm i
npm run dev
```

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
